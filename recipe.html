      <li>1½ cups canned plum tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>12 green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced oregano</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step <br />Toss eggplant with salt and place in a colander set over a
        bowl. Let sit, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 
        <br />Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
        Add celery; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add
        onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and lightly golden,
        about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 
        <br />Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Add
        eggplant and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 5 to 7
        minutes. Stir in celery mixture, tomatoes, olives, capers, tomato paste,
        and oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered
        until caponata is thickened, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 
        <br />Season caponata with vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper.
